# UWCB 04 - Code Quiz
Homework assignment for unit 4 of UW Coding Bootcamp.

## üéØ GOAL
The goal of this assignment is to create a timed quiz game to test your JavaScript knowledge.

## ‚úÖ TASKS
For this project, I need to build a site from scratch that will do the following tasks.
- When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, the quiz should start and the user will be shown the first question.
- When the user selects one of the answers, the selection should be evaluated and the next question should be presented to the user.
    - If the user selected the correct answer, the score should be increased by one.
    - If the user selected the wrong answer, the timer should be decremented by some amount.
- When the user has answered the last question or the timer runs out, then the quiz will end.
- At the end of the quiz, the user should be asked for his or her initials. 
- The user's initials and score should be stored to local storage.

As the user answers the questions, they are able to see which questions have already been answered, which ones 
were correct and incorrect, and how many questions remain.

When the timer runs out or the user has answered the last question, the quiz will end and the user will be brought to
the get name page where he or she will be able to submit their score and initials.
